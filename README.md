# Amazon Food Review
This project aims to build a prediction model where we will be able to predict whether a recommendation is positive or negative. In this analysis, we will not focus on the Score, but only the positive/negative sentiment of the recommendation.            

We created new variables and converted variables into the desired data types, built a term-doc incidence matrix, created the cloud word, and conduct exploratory data analysis. Methods used in building term-doc incidence matrix are:          
- stopwords removal           
- stemming           
- punctuation removal           
- Lowercase the capital letters           
           
Three methods were used in converting text into vectorï¼š           
- Uni-gram bag of words           
- Bi-gram bag of words           
- TF-IDF           

Two models were used in this project:           
- Logistic Regression           
- Random Forest Regression
